Do not use a framework, this is going do be done all with vanilla JS.

Outline:
- get data from the server: https://dino-1-server.herokuapp.com/
- render a list in the #job-listings ul
- when you submit the form, a new job should populate in the list
- when you're finished with functionality, deploy to firebase or another hosting service
